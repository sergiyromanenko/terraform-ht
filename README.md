Pre-requisites

    You must have Terraform installed on your computer.
    You must have an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.

Please note that this code was written for Terraform 0.13.x.
Quick start

Please note that this example will deploy real resources into your AWS account. 
I have made every effort to ensure all the resources qualify for the AWS Free Tier, but some charges for RDS and S3 may incur.

Configure your AWS access keys as environment variables:

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=(your access key id)
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=(your secret access key)

Insert ssh public key to
ProjectHT/Test/variables.tf

variable "public_key" {
  #insert your pub key here for access to EC2 servers
  default = "ssh-rsa ...."
}

Deploy the code:

cd ProjectHT/Test/


terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

Clean up when you're done:

terraform destroy
